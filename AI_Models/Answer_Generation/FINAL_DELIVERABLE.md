## 📊 Test Results (ACTUAL OUTPUT from Your API Key)

### ✅ Test 1: Python Developer (Medium Difficulty)

**Generated Questions:**
1. How do Django's ORM QuerySets work differently from direct SQL queries in terms of lazy evaluation and caching?
2. Describe a scenario where you would use a ManyToManyField in Django and explain how this relationship is represented in the underlying PostgreSQL database schema.
3. You have a Django application packaged in a Docker container; outline the key considerations and steps for deploying it to a production environment.
4. Your Django application is experiencing slow page loads due to inefficient database queries. Detail your approach to diagnose the bottleneck.
5. How would you design and implement a reliable background task processing system for a Django application?

### ✅ Test 2: Feedback Generation

**Sample Answer:** _"Decorators in Python are functions that modify the behavior of other functions..."_

**Generated Feedback:**
> "You provided a clear and accurate definition of Python decorators, which demonstrates good foundational knowledge of Python syntax and their common uses. However, the question was specifically focused on the differences between Django ORM QuerySets and direct SQL queries..."

### ✅ Test 3: Full Stack Developer (Hard Difficulty)

**Generated Questions:**
1. Describe the React reconciliation process and how it changes with Concurrent Mode enabled.
2. Design a robust transactional system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that ensures atomicity, consistency, and durability for an order placement process.
3. Outline a comprehensive architecture for a real-time collaborative document editing application, similar to Google Docs.
4. Detail your systematic approach to identify, diagnose, and resolve performance bottlenecks in a Node.js API serving a React frontend.
5. Design the MongoDB schema to efficiently track complex, nested user activity logs.

## 📝 API Key Configuration

**API Key:** Stored securely in `.env` file (gitignored)

**✅ Configured via:**
- `.env` file in project root (loaded automatically by `load_dotenv()`)

**To set manually in PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

Or add your key to the `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
